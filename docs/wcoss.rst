Installing on WCOSS
===================

If you have access to the NOAA WCOSS machines you can create your own python environments very
easily using intel-python.::

   module load ips/19.0.5.281

Then it is suggested to create a .condarc file that lives in your `$HOME` folder to point to
a location that will house your conda environments.  Below is a sample .condarc file.::

   channels:
     - intel
     - conda-forge
     - defaults
   envs_dirs:
     - /gpfs/dell2/emc/verification/noscrub/User.Name/conda/envs
   pkgs_dirs:
     - /gpfs/dell2/emc/verification/noscrub/User.Name/conda/pkgs

Next you should start a new environment by cloning the default environment to a new name. This can be done in a
single command.::

  conda create -n myenv --clone="/usrx/local/prod/intel/2019UP05/intelpython3"

A prompt should come up and tell you to activate the environment you just created, myenv.::

   source activate myenv

From here you can install any package the same way you could on regular anaconda installations.::

   conda install -c conda-forge monetio
